# Vanshika_Jain
Hello Guy's I'm Vanshika Jain. I'have created a project in my first year of "BCA". It's a "PORTFOLIO" that I'have completed, in which I have included about me, ans my last some projects that I have made sometimes ago. Technology used-: HTML for the purpose of structure, CSS for the purpose of designing and JAVASCRIPT also. In this, I'have learned quite a lot and will learnes much more in my upcoming projects. I hope guy's everyone likes it...
